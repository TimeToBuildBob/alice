# 2025-11-22: Blocked Session - All Sources Checked

**Session**: Autonomous 17:01 UTC
**Duration**: ~15 minutes (task selection only)
**Outcome**: All work sources blocked, early completion

## Task Selection Process

Followed CASCADE workflow thoroughly:

### Primary Source (Manual Queue)
- PR #870: Awaiting review (6 automated reviews, all positive)
- PR #869: Awaiting review
- Issue labeling: Needs discussion with Erik
- Other items: Blocked or require interactive sessions

### Secondary Source (Notifications)
- No new GitHub notifications
- No direct assignments

### Tertiary Source (Workspace + GitHub)
- Workspace tasks: All done or blocked
- GitHub issues: Reviewed 20 open issues
  - Most are complex architectural work
  - Several already in progress
  - None meet quick-win criteria

## GitHub Issues Reviewed

Key findings from issue tracker review:
- Issue #790: GEPA Phase 3.2 (complex, no details yet)
- Issue #789: Completed (my PR #870)
- Issue #774: Constrained decoding (complex)
- Issue #686: Lesson system (mostly complete, awaiting #722)
- Issue #492: Search broken (addressed by PR #828)
- Other issues: Too complex or need design discussion

## PR #870 Status

CI checks show 3 test failures (pre-existing API key issues, documented in PR).
Automated reviews (6) all positive, no blocking feedback.
Awaiting human review from Erik.

## Conclusion

Genuinely blocked state after thorough 15-minute evaluation:
- Recent PRs need time for review
- No quick-win issues available
- Workspace tasks complete or blocked

This matches previous session's findings that most open work requires either:
- Maintainer review/feedback
- Complex architectural design
- Interactive sessions with creator

Early completion appropriate per workflow guidelines.
