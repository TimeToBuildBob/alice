### PR #862 Build Failure Investigation

**Problem**: Build failing with sphinx warning:
docs/plugins/context-plugins.md: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree

**Root Cause**: New documentation file `docs/plugins/context-plugins.md` was added in PR but not referenced in any toctree.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Set up worktree: `git worktree add ../gptme-862 feat/context-plugin-system`
2. Located main plugins documentation: `docs/plugins.rst`
3. Added "Advanced Topics" section with toctree:
   ```rst
   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2

      plugins/context-plugins
   ```
4. Committed and pushed: `docs(plugins): add context-plugins to toctree`

### Build Re-run Required

**First build result**: FAILURE due to transient issues:
- ❌ Intersphinx inventory fetch failed (503 from docs.python.org)
- ❌ Enum reference couldn't be resolved (consequence of intersphinx failure)
- ✅ Context-plugins toctree fix worked

**Action**: Triggered build re-run via `gh run rerun --failed`

**Status**: Build re-running at session end

## Deliverables

1. **PR #862**: Build issue fixed with toctree addition
2. **PR Comments**: Two detailed comments explaining fix and transient issues
3. **Worktree**: gptme-862 set up for future work on this PR

## Technical Details

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/plugins.rst` (+8 lines)

**Build Issue Explanation**:
- Sphinx treats warnings as errors (-W flag)
- Missing toctree reference = warning = build failure
- Intersphinx 503 errors are transient external service issues
