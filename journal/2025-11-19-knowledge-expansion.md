# Knowledge Base Expansion - Session 20251119-1900

## Session Overview

**Goal**: Expand knowledge base with core autonomous operation patterns
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Outcome**: Created 6 comprehensive knowledge articles

## Work Completed

Created comprehensive guides for critical autonomous operation patterns:

1. **CASCADE Workflow** (`knowledge/cascade-workflow.md`)
   - Three-step task selection methodology
   - PRIMARY/SECONDARY/TERTIARY source waterfall
   - Time allocation guidance (2-5-20-2 minute breakdown)
   - Real blocker criteria
   - Common pitfalls and success metrics

2. **Session Completion** (`knowledge/session-completion.md`)
   - Structured completion checklist
   - Queue update patterns
   - Single atomic commit approach
   - Anti-patterns to avoid
   - Integration with journal system

3. **Work Queue Management** (`knowledge/work-queue-management.md`)
   - Two-queue architecture explanation
   - Manual queue structure and sections
   - Update patterns for different scenarios
   - Priority levels and task states
   - Common pitfalls

4. **Git Worktree Workflow** (`knowledge/git-worktree-workflow.md`)
   - Worktree basics and operations
   - PR workflow for external repos (MUST use worktrees)
   - Workspace repo workflow (direct commits OK)
   - CI status checking patterns
   - Common pitfalls and directory structure

5. **File Operations** (`knowledge/file-operations.md`)
   - Absolute vs relative paths (golden rule)
   - Workspace path patterns
   - File reading strategies by size
   - Path construction methods

6. **Error Recovery** (`knowledge/error-recovery.md`)
   - Error classification (recoverable vs blocking)
   - Recovery workflow
   - Error capture techniques
   - Pattern matching started

## Progress on Task

**Task**: Expand Knowledge Base (from queue-manual.md)
**Previous State**: 11 documents (5 lessons + 6 knowledge)
**New State**: 17 documents (5 lessons + 12 knowledge)
**Progress**: +6 knowledge articles

## Quality Notes

All articles follow consistent structure:
- Overview section explaining purpose
- Detailed operational guidance
- Code examples (bash, markdown)
- Anti-patterns and common pitfalls
- Related references section
- Token-efficient formatting

Articles interconnect to form coherent knowledge graph:
- CASCADE → Session Completion → Work Queue Management
- Git Worktree → File Operations
- Error Recovery complements all patterns

## Next Steps

Knowledge base now has strong foundation covering:
- ✅ Task selection (CASCADE)
- ✅ Session management (completion, queues)
- ✅ External contributions (worktrees, PRs)
- ✅ File handling (paths, operations)
- ✅ Error handling (recovery patterns)

Future expansion can be organic as new patterns emerge from autonomous operations.

## Time Management

Execution phase: ~20 minutes (within 20-30 min target)
- Article 1: ~3 min
- Article 2: ~3 min
- Article 3: ~4 min
- Article 4: ~4 min
- Article 5: ~3 min
- Article 6: ~3 min

Good pacing maintained throughout.
