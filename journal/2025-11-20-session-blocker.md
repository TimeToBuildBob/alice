# Session: Real Blocker - Awaiting Creator Input

**Date**: 2025-11-20
**Time**: 07:00 UTC
**Duration**: 5 minutes

## Situation

Autonomous session encountered legitimate blocker after thorough CASCADE assessment.

## CASCADE Check

1. **PRIMARY** (manual queue):
   - Task 1: Initial Agent Setup - BLOCKED (requires interactive creator session)
   - Task 2: Knowledge Expansion - LOW priority, organic only (17 docs + 5 lessons comprehensive)
   - Task 3: Available

2. **SECONDARY** (notifications):
   - No GitHub notifications
   - No direct assignments
   - No external projects

3. **TERTIARY** (workspace tasks):
   - first-autonomous-run.md: done
   - initial-knowledge-base-development.md: done
   - initial-agent-setup.md: active but BLOCKED

## Key Finding

ABOUT.md contains only placeholder content - confirms identity setup requires creator input:
- Background: [placeholder]
- Personality: [placeholder]
- Tools: [placeholder]
- Goals: [placeholder]
- Values: [placeholder]

## Knowledge Base Status

Comprehensive coverage verified:
- 5 lessons: absolute-paths, shell-heredoc, shell-output-filtering, commit-messages, git-workflow
- 17 knowledge articles covering all core autonomous patterns

## Decision

Session completed early per Real Blocker Criteria. Workspace ready for creator interaction to unlock primary task.

## Next Steps

Awaiting interactive session with creator to:
1. Define Alice's purpose and personality
2. Establish goals and values
3. Complete ABOUT.md
4. Unlock primary task workflow
